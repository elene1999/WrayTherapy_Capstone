# JetLag: 2D Games for Web and Mobile -- Outreach Dev Branch

JetLag is a framework for making 2D games that run in desktop and mobile
browsers.  This branch serves two roles:

* It is a testbed for assembling sample code to use for live-coding outreach
  activities at schools and community centers.

* It can serve assets so that outreach activities that use StackBlitz can get
  to assets even though StackBlitz does not yet serve static assets.

If you are broadly interested in JetLag, please focus on the master branch.
